# TODO

- Finish normal table
    - Default order of columns?
    - Table is too wide - shorten column names - maybe a flag that makes it full or short?
    - Should items be lowercase?
        - Table contents
            - Element names and symbols are uppercase, but these come from the library
            - Other items that are uppercase come from strings I'm forming
        - Column names
- A periodic table filtered down to just groups (might not be necessary after number 1, but might be neat for visuals)
    - v0.2.0
- Make sure all the naming of things make sense
    - Variables and function names
- Fix up categories listed in `help commands | where is_plugin == true` (are these correct?)
- Run cargo fmt, clippy, etc.
- Add to CHANGELOG.md and README.md
- Publish to crates.io (correct toml metadata - author, etc)
- Add releases to GitHub
