# TODO

- Make sure all the naming of things make sense
    - Variables and function names
    - Things that are displayed
        - Should plugin name be one word?  ptab?
        - Should the column names be reduced down to one word since they require quotes to work with currently?
- Ask community for opinions
- General cleanup
- Fix up categories listed in `help commands | where is_plugin == true` (are these correct?)
- Add REAMD.md
- Run cargot fmt, clippy, etc.
- Make a changelog
- Publish to crates.io (correct toml metadata - author, etc)
- Add releases to GitHub

1. Finish normal table
    - Default order of columns?
    - Table is too wide - shorten column names - maybe a flag that makes it full or short?
2. A periodic table filtered down to just groups (might not be necessary after number 1, but might be neat for visuals)
    - v0.2.0
